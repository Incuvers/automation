## Preface
This repository hosts all the automation and management services for Incuvers' servers. This repository hosts the ansible automation for building and destroying continous deployment pipeline stages for the [Incuvers:monitor](https://github.com/Incuvers/monitor) repository. In the future it will also be expanded to include virtual incubator servers and running R&D cluster computing applications.
